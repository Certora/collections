/**
    Marks a generic type parameter as needing stable hash codes *if* the type might be involved in serialization. NOTE:
    It exists specifically for generic collection types (see AbstractTreapSet example below)!

    Such a parameter will accept an argument that either a) is definitely not serializable, or b) has a stable hash
    code.

    A type is definitely not serializable if it doesn't implement Serializable *and* it is final or sealed - and all
    subclasses are definitely not serializable.

    This allows collection types to rely on stable hash codes for serialization, but otherwise not require them.  E.g.:

        ```
        class AbstractTreapSet<@Treapable T>(): Serializable
        ```

    `AbstractTreapSet` can rely on hashCode stability in its serialization code, because if T is serializable, it also
    has a stable hash code.  But we're free to instantiate `AbstractTreapSet<UnstableType>`, as long as `UnstableType`
    definitely not serializable.
