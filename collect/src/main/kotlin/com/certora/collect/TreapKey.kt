/**
    Provides properties and methods over Treap keys.  See `Treap` for an overview.  This is an interface rather than an
    abstract class so that it can be "mixed into" other classes with their own bases.

    A "treap key" is a value that locates a treap node in a treap.  The location has two coordinates: sort order, and
    priority.  Sort order is the position in the treap from left to right.  Priority is top to bottom.

    The treap key is related to, but not the same as, the key used for map entries or set elements.  For map/set keys
    that implement Comparable, the map/set key is used as the treap key directly.  The ordering defined by the key type
    determines the treap sort order; priority is determined by a hash of the key's hashCode.  For map/set keys that
    don't implement a total ordering via Comparable, we bucket keys by hash code.  Buckets sort from left to right
    according to their hashCode values; priorities are again assigned by hashing the hashCode.  Within the buckets, we
    use chaining to maintain distinct map/set keys.

        If result == 0, we require that the two keys have equal hashCodes as well, so that they will have the same
