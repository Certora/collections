    Treaps are probabilistically balanced binary search trees.  We use these to implement efficient persistent Set and
    Map data structures.  For background reading, see:

    "Randomized Search Trees", Seidel and Aragon, 1996:
        https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221498261_Randomized_Search_Trees

    "Fast Set Operations Using Treaps", Belloch and Reid-Miller, 1998:
        https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~scandal/papers/treaps-spaa98.pdf

    A Treap is a binary search tree (BST) where each node has two properties: its "key" value, and its "priority." Keys
    are organized according to the usual BST rule (lower values on the left, higher on the right).  To balance the tree,
    nodes are additionally organized by priority, with higher-priority nodes appearing "above" lower- priority nodes, a
    la heaps.  Priorities are assigned "randomly" (more on that later), so that the tree ends up probabilistically
    balanced, such that the expected depth of the tree is O(log(N)).

    In the original Treap paper, the idea was to assign nodes random priorities with an RNG.  However, in the footnotes
    it was suggested that a hash of the node's key could be used instead.  We have taken this suggestion.  Also, when
    comparing two nodes' priorities, we break ties by comparing the nodes' keys.  Thus we have a total ordering on
    priority.  This priority scheme - hashing plus total ordering - has a couple of huge advantages: First, it allows us
    to balance the tree without storing any additional data, since we can recompute the priorities on-demand from the
    key values.  Second, it means that two treaps containing the same keys, and balanced with the same hash function,
    will have identical shapes.  This makes set operators more efficient, and allows for efficient "merging" of map
    data.

    We also modify the Set operations from Belloch and Reid-Miller, to add an additional invariant that Set operations
    whose result is equal to the left hand side of the operation, return the same Set reference that was passed to the
    LHS of the operator.  T.g., (A union B) === A, if B is a subset of A.  This allows us to efficiently detect
    modification of sets, which has performance benefits all over the place, and it allows greater re-use of the memory
    already allocated.

    As a BST, Treaps are well-suited to keys with a defined total ordering.  For values which implement Comparable, we
    use the value itself as the Treap key.  However, we need to be able to use arbitrary types as elements of Set, or as
    keys in Maps.  For types that do not implement Comparable, we use the object's hashCode() function to generate a
    Treap key.  We thus sort all elements/keys by their hash codes.  We resolve collisions by chaining off of the Treap
    node.  This results in a bifurcation of Set and Map implementations, into SortedTreapSet and HashTreapSet,
    SortedTreapMap and HashTreapMap.

    Some other notes:

    - We save quite a bit of memory by deriving our Map and Set classes directly from Treap, rather han encapsulating
      the Treap node objects.  This means that Treap instances are exposed directly to code using Set and Map objects.
      It's thus important that Treap not implement any public interfaces that the Map and Set objects should not
      implement.  For example, it might be tempting to make Treap implement Comparable, but that would make all derived
      Set and Map types comparable, which is probably not wise.

    - All Treap instances must implement TreapKey, allowing them to be used in key comparisons.  Other objects also
      implement TreapKey, for example when adding a new element to a set, we allocate a new, temporary, TreapKey with a
      precomputed priority, to speed up priority computations.

    - To ensure "persistence" of these data structures, all instances of Treap are deeply immutable.  "Mutation" is
      always done by making a new instance.  We go to lengths to avoid this, and also to throw out any copies if they
      turn out to be unnecessary, so that we maximize our chances of reusing existing memory allocations, in the hope of
      keeping memory small.  Often a union of two large Sets, for example, will reuse a substantial portion of both
      sets.

    - Most Treap operations are defined recursively.  This should not lead to stack overflow, as Treaps are very likely
      to be mostly balanced.  The expected (ideal) depth of a Treap is O(log2(N)), so we don't expect to see Treaps that
      are much more than, say, 64 nodes deep.

    - We take advantage of the total ordering we impose on Treap priorities, to avoid additional key comparisons. We
      never need to check if two keys are equal, if their nodes' priorities have already been compared.

    - Treaps impose special requirements on keys if they are serialized.  See [Treapable].
