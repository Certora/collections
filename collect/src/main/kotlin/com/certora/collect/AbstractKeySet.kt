/**
    Presents the keys of a [TreapMap] as a [TreapSet].

    The idea here is that a `TreapMap<K, *>` is stored with the same Treap structure as a `TreapSet<K>`, so we can very
    quickly create the corresponding `TreapSet<K>` when needed, in O(n) time (as opposed to the naive O(n*log(n))
    method).

    We lazily initialize the set, so that we don't create it until we need it.  For many operations, we can avoid
    creating the set entirely, and just use the map directly.  However, many operations, e.g. [addAll]/[union] and
    [retainAll/intersect], are much more efficient when we have a [TreapSet], so we create it when needed.

    Note: It would be really nice if we could just treat the [TreapMap] objects themselves as [TreapSet] objects, but
    this presents some problems.  The most fundamental problem is that the [TreapMap] and [TreapSet] interfaces have
    methods that are not compatible; for example, they both implement [Iterable], but with different element types.
